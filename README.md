Smartmontools for Windows Package
(C) 2012-2016 Orsiris de Jong - http://www.netpower.fr

Smartmontools For Windows is an alternate package for smartmontools by Bruce Allen and Christian Franke, and has been created to quickly install smartmontools as service, support mail or local alerts, and preconfigure smart monitor options.
Installation can be run silently with command line parameters for massive deployments, or graphically for standard users.

Configuration files are automatically generated (but you can still enjoy manual editing of course).
A service called "SmartD" is created and launched at system startups. This service will enumerate hard disks smartmontools can monitor and send an email and/or show a local message in case of errors.
A file called smart.log is created on error, including all smart information, and sent by mail. A error action log is created under erroraction.log.

Optionally, an initial smart.log file is kept on the disk, in the case you want to keep initial smart infos for warranty issues.

This software and the software it installs are under GPL licence. No responsibility will be taken for any problems or malfunctions that may occur while using this software.

Anyway,feel free to send a mail to ozy [at] netpower.fr for limited support on my free time.

--short=S/MM/DD/d/HH Regular expression that determines when to run short selftest, set to everyday day 10AM if not defined
	You can disable short autotests by specifying --short=no
	(see below or smartd.conf manual for details about the regular expressions used)
	You may also set this parameter to no if you don't want to run short selftests
--long=L/MM/DD/d/HH Regular expression that determines when to run long selftest, set to every friday at 13AM if not defined
	You can disable long autotests by specifying --long=no
	(see below or smartd.conf manual for details about the regular expressions used)
--hddlist="/dev/pd0;/dev/pd1;/dev/sdc" Device list separated by semicolons. If not defined, hdds will be autodetected.
Example: --hddlist="/dev/csmi0,0;/dev/csmi0,1" for an Intel RAID of two disks (intel raid autodetection does not always work, this does)
--checkhealth=(yes|no) is activated by default
--checkataerrors=(yes|no) is activated by default
--checkfailureusage=(yes|no) is activated by default
--reportselftesterrors=(yes|no) is activated by default
--reportcurrentpendingsect=(yes|no) is activated by default
--reportofflineuncorrectsect=(yes|no) is activated by default
--trackchangeusageprefail=(yes|no) is activated by default
--ignoretemperature=(yes|no) is activated by default
--powermode=(never|sleep|standby|idle) Determines in which minimal powermode is required for selftests to be run. Is set to sleep if not defined
--maxskips=N Maximum number of tests to skip because of the powermode before a test is forced. Is set to 7 by default

-f Email address your alert mail will come from
-t destination email address for your alert
-s your smtp server
--port=your smtp server port (defaults to 25)
-u your smtp server username (not mandatory)

--sendtestmessage=(yes|no) is activated if not defined
--mailer=(mailsend|sendemail) You may use an alternative mailer (mailsend is default)
/silent or /verysilent are silent switches. Please be aware these are the only switches using a slash, as they are Inno Setup internal logic switches.

See examples below

Selftest regular expressions
----------------------------

Regular expressions would look like T/MM/DD/d/HH where
T = type of test (S=short, L=long)
MM = Month (January = 01, December = 12)
DD = Day of month (01...31)
d = Day of week (Monday = 1, Sunday = 7)
HH = Hour in 24H format

You can replace any date/time related value by points, which are wildcards. The following regular expression would schedule a long test every tuesday and friday at 02AM:

L/../../[2,5]/02

Examples
--------

A basic installation script:

smartmontools-win-6.4-4.exe -f sourcemail@example.tld -t destination@example.tld -s smtp.of.your.isp.com /silent

This line would silently install smartmontools mail alerts, autodetection of hdds, using all monitor parameters, and schedule a short selftest every day at 08AM and a long selftest every friday at 12AM.

An other example would be that would use tls for mails, authentificate on your ISP's SMTP server, never ignore temperature changes, show local warning messages, disables short tests and schedules a long selftest every tuesday and sunday at 02PM for the drives /dev/pd0 and /dev/csmi0,1 would look like

smartmontools-win-6.4-4.exe -f sourcemail@example.tld -t destination@example.tld -s smtp.of.your.isp.com --port 587 -u username@smtp.server.tld -p pA55W0RD --tls=yes --ignoretemperature=no --hddlist=/dev/pd0;/dev/csmi0,1 --short=no --long=L/../../[2,7]/02 --localmessages=yes /silent
